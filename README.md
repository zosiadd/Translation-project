The idea behind our project is to create a program that will allow the user to
convert a nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence. Keeping in mind that
genetic code is degenerate - several different codons encode the same
amino acid. It is supposed to require the user only to enter the sequence of
nucleotide sequence according to the rules of the genetic code. According to the
project we are to use a graphical interface, so it is important that it is clear and
understandable to the user. If an incorrect sequence is entered, the user will be
informed about it in the result window named: Translation Result. 
Also, we have added the option to insert a random mRNA sequence (Random button), 
as well as checking repeated amino acid sequences (Check button). 
It is also possible to load an mRNA sequence from a file (.txt or fasta) via the Load button and to clear the window (Clear).
